# What is Fino?

A command-line tool for managing personal financial transactions.  
This project provides a lightweight, terminal-based interface for recording, searching, and importing financial data.  
It is designed with a modular architecture that makes it easy to extend with new features over time.

## 🚀 Current Features

### ➤ Add Transactions  
Create a new transaction using this format:
All fields are validated:
- Date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Decimal amount
- Transaction type (`income` or `expense`)
- Description/category length limits

---

### ➤ Remove Transactions  
Remove an entry by providing its UUID.

---

### ➤ Search Transactions  
Search for transactions by category.

---

### ➤ Print All Transactions  
Displays all currently stored transactions.

---

### ➤ Import from CSV  
Import transactions from a CSV file in the following format:
Notes:
- The file **does not need an ID column**.
- A new UUID is generated automatically for each imported transaction.
- The importer uses the `csv` crate.
- All imported lines pass through the same validation rules as manual entries.
- The importer handles:
  - Invalid column counts  
  - Incorrect formats  
  - Binary or unreadable files  
  - Invalid UTF-8  

### 📁 Example CSV File
